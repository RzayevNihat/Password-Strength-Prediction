# Password Strength Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains a list of passwords alongside their corresponding strength classifications. The dataset can be used to train models to predict the strength of passwords based on their structure and content. The strength is categorized into different levels, helping in identifying weak, medium, or strong passwords.

## Description
assword Strength Checker is an application that checks how strong a password is. Some popular password strength meters use machine learning algorithms to predict the strength of your password. So, if you want to learn how to use machine learning to check your password’s strength, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through how to create a password strength checker with machine learning using Python.

### Dataset Structure:

- **password**: This column contains a list of user-created passwords.
- **strength**: This column classifies the password strength into one of the following categories:
  - `Weak`
  - `Medium`
  - `Strong`

### Example Data:

| password    | strength |
|-------------|----------|
| kzde5577    | Medium   |
| kino3434    | Medium   |
| visi7k1yr   | Medium   |
| megzy123    | Medium   |
| lamborghin1 | Medium   |

### Total Number of Records:

- **Passwords**: [Enter number of passwords here]

### Data Preprocessing:

The dataset can be tokenized using methods such as `TfidfVectorizer` to transform the password text into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. It’s important to maintain the feature consistency between training and testing.

### Usage:

1. **Password Strength Classification**: The dataset can be used to train models like RandomForest, XGBoost, or other classifiers to predict password strength.
2. **Password Security Analysis**: It can be employed to study common patterns in weak or strong passwords, enabling insights into better password security practices.

### How to Use:

1. Preprocess the data using techniques such as tokenization (e.g., `TfidfVectorizer`).
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
3. Train a classification model such as `RandomForestClassifier`, `XGBoostClassifier`, or `LogisticRegression`.
4. Evaluate the model and use it to predict the strength of new passwords.

### Tools Required:

- Python (3.x)
- Libraries:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `TfidfVectorizer`
  - `RandomForestClassifier` or other classifiers

### Example Workflow:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a `pandas` DataFrame.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use `TfidfVectorizer` to extract features from the passwords.
3. **Model Training**: Train a model using the features extracted from the password text.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the strength of a new password.
